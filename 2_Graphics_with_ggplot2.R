# Hello and welcome to the code file to accompany Module II of this course.
# The grammar of graphics inspired R package 'ggplot2' is exceptionally well
# documented online.

# Here is an introductory tutorial by the author of `ggplot2 Hadely Wickham:
# <http://rpubs.com/hadley/ggplot-intro>

# Comprensive manual page style help files for each component of 'ggplot2' may
# be found here:
# <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/>

# In this module I will attempt to introduce the key concept necessary to use
# `ggplot2'.

# It all begins with loading the 'ggplot2' package, this loads all the functions
# and data from the package into memory making them available for use in R:

library('ggplot2')

# Before we begin formally here is a quick example to demonstrate the
# flexibility and concieseness of a ploting syntax based on the the grammar of
# graphics.
# (This example uses the 'diamonds' data which are included in the 'ggplot2'
# package:

# Don't worry too much about the syntax just yet, but instead notice how with
# the line of code below a create a plot object and assign it a name:

px <- ggplot(aes(x = cut, fill = cut), data = diamonds) + geom_bar(width = 1)

# Executing the named plot object produces a bar chart:
px

# Changing the coordinate system produces a coxcomb plot:
px + coord_polar()

# then changine which variable is mapped to angle in the polar coordinate system
# produces a different plot again:

px + coord_polar(theta = 'y')

# Note how little additional code was required for these transformations...

# Each of these plots would have had to be produced separately in R base
# graphics i.e. we could not have simply altered the coordinate system of a bar
# plot and produced a coxcomb plot.

# If you like coordinate systems check out the 2D projections of the spherical
# Earth in this example:
## <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/coord_map.html>

# Now let's begin the formal introduction.
# We'll use the 'crabs' dataframe that comes with the MASS package:

library(MASS)

attach(crabs)

summary(crabs)

?crabs

# Let's start with a scatter plot of carapace width against carapace length

# First we define a plotting object, let's call it clcw.sp.
# To do this we first define which columns of the data will be mapped to spatial
# coordinates in the plot.  Spatial coordinates are one of the 'aethetics' of a
# plot produced with ggplot2 - when we map column of a dataframe to particular
# 'aesthetics' of a plot with the ggplot command we need to do so via a comma
# separated list with the aes( ) component of the ggplot( ) command.
# Below we map the column named 'CL' from the dataframe 'crabs' to horizontal
# spatial coordinates in the plot and we map column named 'CW', also from the
# dataframe 'crabs' to vertical coordinates of the plot. 

clcw.sp <- ggplot(aes(x = CL, y = CW), data = crabs)

# So far we have only specified which variables to maps the spatial coordinates
# in the plot.  Until we specify a geometry nothing will be drawn.

clcw.sp

# Let's request the points geometry be drawn (i.e. one point will be a drawn at
# the coordinates represented by each row in the dataframe crabs when we take
# the column 'CL' as the horizontal coordinates of the points and column 'CW' as
# vertical coordinates of the points).

clcw.sp + geom_point()

# this produces a scatter plot

# ggplot2 includes quite a few geometries that can be added to plots.
# each geometry has a help page with examples on the
# <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/coord_map.html>

# now as the vertical and horizontal axes have the same units (mm) we may want
# both axes to have the same scale (i.e. have one unit of CL map to the same
# spatial displacement (horizontally) as as one unit of CW maps to vertically).

clcw.sp + geom_point() + coord_equal()

# I have a few plans for additional arguments we'll pass to the points geometry
# so we won't store that in clcw.sp just yet but we'll store the specification
# that the horiztonal and vertical axes should have the same scale

clcw.sp <- clcw.sp + coord_equal()

clcw.sp # still no geometry stored yet as we are still experimenting with it

clcw.sp + geom_point()
# but we have stored the specification that the coordinates should be on the
# same scale

# next up we can make the axis labels more informative:
clcw.sp <- clcw.sp + labs(x = 'Carapace Width (mm)', y = 'Carapace Length (mm)')

clcw.sp + geom_point()

# ok now let's add some more information to plot using colour to represent the
# species of the crab being measured.
# point colour is another aesthetic to which we may map a column in the data
# (in this case the column containing the one letter code representing the
# crabs' sex) as such the mapping of 'sp' to 'colour' occurs within the
# aes( ) component of the point geometry as we are only mapping 'sp' values to
# the colour of the points

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp))

# if we had say both point and line geometries in the plot then using
# '+ geom_point(aes(colour = sp))' would map 'sp' to the colour of the points
# alone e.g.

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) + geom_line()

# had we wanted to have 'sp' mapped to the colour of every geometry drawn we
# would have need to make this mapping global by including it in the original
# aes( ) component of the ggplot(aes( ) ) command where we specified which
# columns to map to spatial positioning as a global mapping that would be
# applied to all subsequent geometries which we added to the plot 

# now we will update the labels to include a more informative colour label

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) + labs(colour = 'Species')

# if we check 

?crabs

# we see that values of 'B' in the column 'sp' represent the blue form of this
# species and values of 'O' in this column represent the orange form of this
# species so we may wish to colour the points accordingly
# to this we need manually specify the scale by which the categorical variable
# sp is mapped to the colour aesthetic
# in ggplot2 'scales' control the mapping of column in the data (variables) to
# 'aesthetics' of the plot

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) +
    labs(colour = 'Species') +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("cyan3", "orange"))

# Scrolling down <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/coord_map.html> will take you
# to the section that lists help pages on 'scales'

# A long list of named colours available for use in R may be found at:
# <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf>

# If you have three or more levels of a variable you wish to depict on a graph
# via a discrete colour scale you may find <http://colorbrewer2.org/> useful

# you may specify colour by hex values directly:
clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) +
    labs(colour = 'Species') +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("#008B8B", "#ffa500"))

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) +
    labs(colour = 'Species') +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("cyan3", "orange"))

# You may also update the what is printed next to each colour in the legend with
# the 'labels' argument of the scale command:

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp)) +
    labs(colour = 'Species') +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("cyan3", "orange"),
                        labels = c('Blue', 'Orange'))

# this all looks good so lets add the additional lables and the scale
# specification to the features of plot stored in the plot object clcw.sp

clcw.sp <- clcw.sp +
              labs(colour = 'Species') +
              scale_colour_manual(values = c("cyan3", "orange"), labels = c('Blue', 'Orange'))

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp))

# Now let's map the crab sex to the aesthetic of the points whic controls the
# shape of the points

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp, shape = sex))

# There's quite a bit of overlap among the data so we could set the  points to
# be semitransparent

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp, shape = sex), alpha = 0.5)

# note I could have mapped another variable to the transparency by assigning
# some variable to 'alpha' within the aes( ) component but instead I am setting
# all points to have the same alpha of 0.5 (i.e. be 50% transparent) by equating
# alpha with a single number outside the aes( ) component of the command

# similarly I can set all the points to be a particular size by setting 'size'
# equal to a single number outside the aes( ) component of the command
# with semitransparent points we can have them a bit bigger

clcw.sp + geom_point(aes(colour = sp, shape = sex), alpha = 0.25, size = 3)

# In this case transparency doesn help a great deal

# Instead for such situtations I recommend using faceting to produce
# Edward Tufte style small multiples
# the best way to understand what this means is to do it

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp, shape = sex), alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
    facet_wrap( ~ sp)

# what we have done here is create two subsets of the data one for the rows
# where sp = B (i.e. the blue crabs) and another for the rows where sp = O
# i.e. the orange crabs
# two otherwise identical plots have been produced side by side one of which
# plots the subset of the data where sp = B (the blue crabs) and the other where
# sp = O (the orange crabs)

# we can also facet by two categorical variable here 'sp' and 'sex':

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sp, shape = sex), alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
    facet_grid(sex ~ sp)

# which results in four plots each containing the data from a different unique
# subset of the full dataframe where these subsets were defined by the 4 unique
# combinations of crab colour form and sex

# the mapping of species to colour and sex to shape is now redundant (i.e. we
# represented this information by both the faceting and by characteristics of
# the points)

# if we were restricted to black and white or grey scale graphics (as is often
# the case with graphics for journal articles) we can still have the values of
# all four of the variables 'CL', 'CW', 'sp' and 'sex' for each crab conveyed by
# a black and white plot via the use of faceting

clcw.sp +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
    facet_grid(sex ~ sp) +
    theme_bw()

# It's acutally easier to create new factors than to change facet labels

# ggplot2 is capable of geospatial visualisations (e.g. of raster data such as
# georeferenced satellite imagery or elevation data and of spatial polygons
# e.g. statistical local areas)

# For this geospatial visualisation example I'm going to use another package
# 'raster' (which in turn uses functions from the 'rgdal' package) to do the
# majority of the work but I will visualise the results with 'ggplot2'

# 'ggplot2' is capable of visualising raster imagery once you convert the
# imagery into 'long' format, which in the case of a raster, equates to a
# dataframe with columns for the coordinates and value of each pixel and pixels
# listed as subsequent rows

# if you're going to be doing lots of geospatial modelling and visualisation
# it may well be easier to work with the base graphics functions provided with
# the 'raster' package which will avoid the necessity to transform all the
# rasters to long format which as rasters get bigger gets increasingly
# computationall expensive and time consuming 

# However for small to medium sized rasters (relative to your computers' RAM)
# 'ggplot2' can produce good geostatial visualisations in a timely fashion

# if you are starting to run this code file from here you will need to load the
# ggplot2 package into memory:

library('ggplot2')

# and everyone will need to load the 'raster' package into memory

library('raster')

# (hopefully you were all able to install the R package 'raster'
# you may have needed to install the R package 'rgdal' first)

# first we begin by reading the raster (in this case a GeoTIFF) into R
# (a GeoTIFF is a raster image that has spatial positioning information
#  associated with the image included in the file)

# To load the GeoTIFF into R please this run the line of code below and select
# the file 'landsat_crop.tif' from the dialoguge box that opens
# this file is located at '~/Data/landsat_crop.tif' where the ~
# represents the file path to where you extracted the 'Intro_to_R' directory
# to when you first downloaded it from GitHub

Desert.rst <- raster(x = file.choose())

# alternatively use

setwd('../Dropbox/R-book/R-WORKSHOP/Intro_to_R-1.01/Data/Graphics_with_ggplot2/')
Desert.rst <- raster(x = 'landsat_crop.tif')

# for the polygon drawing below to work we need to get R to open an external
# graphics device. normally we'd use dev.new() for a platform independent way
# to do this however RStudio and dev.new() don't play nicely together so

# on MS Windows systems try:

windows()

# on MacOS systems try:

quartz()

# or

x11()

# on GNU+Linux systems running X11 try

x11()

# once you have an external ploting device open (i.e. another ploting window
# open external to the RStudio window) please run the line below to plot the
# raster in this window

plot(Desert.rst, col = grey(level = 1:1e4/1e4))

# now lets use the mouse to mark out a polygon on the plot
# once you've marked out the polygon either right click or right click and
# select 'close'
